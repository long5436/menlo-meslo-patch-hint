# A modified version of the "menlo" font

A version of Menlo font with hint

:point_right: goto [release page ](https://github.com/nguyenvanlongweb/menlo-patch-hint/releases) to download and use.

Menlo is one of the default monochrome fonts on MacOS, but it doesn't come equipped with hints. So it doesn't render well on windows with low dpi screens, so I made a version with hints for it. And this is a great font, you can see its original artifact with a suggested version via the image below.


This is the original font image without hint:

This is the picture after the hint:
